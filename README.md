## Minimum Rust version policy

The time crate is guaranteed to compile with any release of rustc from the past six months.
Optional feature flags that enable interoperability with third-party crates (e.g. rand)
follow the policy of that crate if stricter.

As the annual Rust survey has shown that an overwhelming majority of users do not use old versions
of rustc, little effort will be made to maintain compatibility. This allows for catering to the
most users possible in a reasonable time frame.
