//! Implementations of the [`quickcheck::Arbitrary`] trait.
//!
//! This enables users to write tests such as this, and have test values
//! provided automatically:
//!
//! ```
//! # #![allow(dead_code)]
//! # use quickcheck_dep::quickcheck;
//! # #[cfg(pretend_we_didnt_rename_the_dependency)]
//! use quickcheck::quickcheck;
//! use time::Date;
//!
//! struct DateRange {
//!     from: Date,
//!     to: Date,
//! }
//!
//! impl DateRange {
//!     fn new(from: Date, to: Date) -> Result<Self, ()> {
//!         Ok(DateRange { from, to })
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! quickcheck! {
//!     fn date_range_is_well_defined(from: Date, to: Date) -> bool {
//!         let r = DateRange::new(from, to);
//!         if from <= to {
//!             r.is_ok()
//!         } else {
//!             r.is_err()
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! An implementation for `Instant` is intentionally omitted since its values
//! are only meaningful in relation to a [`Duration`], and obtaining an
//! `Instant` from a [`Duration`] is very simple anyway.
